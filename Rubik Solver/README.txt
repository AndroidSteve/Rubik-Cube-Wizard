Notice:
  This is currently work-in-progress.  A final stable version will be
  completed around March 2015 and also presented at the Wearable 
  Tech Conference: see http://www.wearablestechcon.com/classes#AndroidAugmentedRealityRubikCubeSolver.
  
  If you are interested in working or forking this code, I recommend that 
  you wait until then.  I will be much more willing to answer questions
  at that time.


Areas that need improve Robustness.  
  o  Rubik Cube manufacturer: shape and exact colors.
  o  Illumination.
  o  Smart Phone/Glasses cpu and gpu horsepower.
  o  Smart Phone/Glasses camera pipeline.
  o  OpenCV, OpenCL, and OpenGL operation of various hardware vendors.
  o  User gesture style.
  
To Do:
  o  Move control mode variables out of MainActivity.
